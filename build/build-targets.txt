# Here lists all the LaTeX build targets.
# Lines starting with # are ignored. Leading and trailing spaces are ignored.
# All targets will be looked up in the /src directory.
# Target name prefixes are supported by TAB indentation. Example:
# 	COMP2120-
# 		Notes
#		Cheatsheet
# will yield two build targets:
#	COMP2120-Notes.tex		(in /src/COMP2120-Notes/COMP2120-Notes.tex)
#	COMP2120-Cheatsheet.tex	(in /src/COMP2120-Cheatsheet/COMP2120-Cheatsheet.tex)
# in /src/COMP2120-Notes/COMP2120-Notes.tex and /src/COMP2120-Cheatsheet/COMP2120-Cheatsheet.tex
# The root tex file must have the same name as the target.
# Multilevel indentation is supported. Example:
#	ENGG1340-
#		Assignment
#			1
#			2
#		Notes
# will yield three targets:
#	ENGG1340-Assignment1.tex 	(in /src/ENGG1340-Assignment1/ENGG1340-Assignment1.tex)
#	ENGG1340-Assignment2.tex 	(in /src/ENGG1340-Assignment2/ENGG1340-Assignment2.tex)
#	ENGG1340-Notes.tex			(in /src/ENGG1340-Notes/ENGG1340-Notes.tex)
# Note that hyphens (-) are not added automatically when resolving the target name.
# Targets of the same prefix declared in different lines will be merged after resolving.
# Duplicate target names will only be resolved once.
