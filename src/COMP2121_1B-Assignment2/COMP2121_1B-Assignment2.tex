    Let $f:A\to B$ be a function. Consider an arbitrary set $A'\subseteq A$.
    The image of set $A'$ is defined to be the set \[
        f(A')=\set{y\in B\mid \exists x\in A'\text{ such that }y=f(x)}.

    \question Asymptotics of Functions

    \begin{parts}
        
        \part[8] For the following functions $f$, $g$, determine whether $f=\bigO(g)$, $f=\Omega(g)$,
        or $f=\Theta(g)$. Justify your answers.

        \begin{subparts}
            
            \subpart $f(n)=2n^2+3n+1$ and $g(n)=n^2$.

            \subpart $f(n)=\log_4 n$ and $g(n)=\log_2 (\log_2 n)$.

            \subpart $f(n)=n!$ and $g(n)=100^n$. [Hint: Consider Stirling's formula.]

        requirements are satisfied:

    \question Basic Counting

    \begin{parts}
        
        \part[4] Among all positive numbers that devide 4050 exactly, how many are multiples of 45?

        \part[4] There are 2 identical red balls and 3 identical black balls.
        You are going to put them into 5 different boxes.
        If each box can contain at most 2 balls, how many ways are there to put the balls in the boxes?

        \part[4] In a game, the player needs to move from the point $(0,0)$ to the point $(a,b)$ where
        $a\geq b>0$ are integers. At each point $(x,y)$, the player can either move right to $(x+1,y)$
        or move up to $(x,y+1)$. It is forbidden to move up for two successive times.
        How many different ways are there for the player to reach $(a,b)$?

    \question Counting Sets and Relations

    \begin{parts}
        
        \part[4] In a group of 15 computer scientists, each scientist has collaborated with at least 8
        other members of the group. Prove that there exist 3 members, such that each one of them has
        collaborated with the other two members.

        \part[6] Let $A$, $B$, $C$ be sets with $\card{A}=\card{B}=\card{C}=n$ and
        $\card{A\cup B\cup C}=m$. Find the minimal value of $\card{A\cap B\cap C}$.

        \part[6] Let $A$ be a set with $\card{A}=5$. Count the number of distinct
        \begin{enumerate*}[label=(\roman*)]
            \item symmetric relations and
            \item assymetric relations
        \end{enumerate*} that can be constructed on $A$.
        An assymetric relation $R$ is a relation such that, for every pair of distinct $x$ and $y$,
        $x\rel y\Rightarrow\neg(y\rel x)$.

    \question Pigeonhole

    \begin{parts}
        
        \part[4] Show that if you have a set $A$ of 5 points $(x_i, y_i)\in\Z^2$, there must exist
        distinct $j, k$ such that, for $(x_j, y_j),(x_k,y_k)\in A$, the midpoint
        $\displaystyle\left(\frac{x_j+x_k}{2},\frac{y_j+y_k}{2}\right)$ also lies in $\Z^2$.

        \part[4] For any $n\in\N$, prove that for any collection of $n+1$ distinct numbers drawn
        from $\set{1,2,\ldots,2n}$, there must be at least one pair of numbers such that one of them
        is a multiple of the other.

    \question Conditional Probability

    You are training a classifier for spam detection using machine learning. Each data point $(x,y)$ in the
    dataset represents an email, which can be categorized as either spam or non-spam, with the content of
    the email denoted as $x$ and a label $y\in{\text{spam},\text{non-spam}}$.

    \begin{parts}
        
        \part[4] Given that 10\% of the data in the dataset is labelled as spam and 90\% is labelled
        as non-spam, and that the model's output satisfies the following conditions: \[
            P(\text{output}=\text{spam}\mid\text{label}=\text{spam})=0.8,\quad
            P(\text{output}=\text{spam}\mid\text{label}=\text{non-spam})=0.9,
        \] determine the probability that the model's output matches the true label when the input is
        randomly selected from the dataset.

        \part[4] Continuing from part (\ref{part@8@1}), calculate the probability that the
        true label is spam given that the model predicts spam.

        \part[4] Suppose the labels are manually provided by users, introducing noise in the dataset. 
        This means some emails have incorrect labels (i.e., the label has been flipped from spam to
        non-spam or vice versa). With the same conditions as in part (\ref{part@8@1}), and given that
        5\% of the emails have incorrect labels, determine the probability that the model categorizes
        a random email from the dataset correctly, regardless of whether the label is accurate.

        \part[4] There are $n$ passengers queuing to board a bus one by one.
        Each passenger has an assigned seat. However, the first passenger does not follow the seating
        arrangement and chooses a seat at random. Subsequently, each passenger takes their assigned
        seat if it is available; otherwise, they select a seat uniformly at random from the remaining
        unoccupied seats. Determine the probability that the last passenger sits in the assigned seat.

        \part[4] A family has two children. It is known that at least one of them is a girl born on
        a Monday. What is the probability that both children are girls?
