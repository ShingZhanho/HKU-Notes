!!! info "HDR Content"

    This video was created in HDR (High Dynamic Range) format.
    If your display does not support HDR, the colours may appear washed out or less vibrant on your screen.

## The Python Source Code

The video uses extensive Manim animations.
The Python source code used to create these animations is available as an archive file.

Python 3.12 was used during development.
Lower versions may work but are not tested.
Please ensure that you have the required dependencies installed.

To build the animations, do:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt         # Install dependencies
manim -qh [SCRIPT_NAME]                 # Render the animation in high quality,
                                        # follow the interactive instructions from Manim.
```

## The Video Project File

The original Adobe Premiere Pro project file, along with all the footages, assets, Adobe After Effects project files, are packed into an archive for download.
You will need Adobe Premiere Pro 2025 and Adobe After Effects 2025 to open and edit the project.
As the archive is large, you will be redirected to Google Drive for downloading.
