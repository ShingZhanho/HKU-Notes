This set of revision notes summarises the key concepts for the course COMP2120 Computer Organisation.

It rearranges the content of the course into seven main topics:

1. Evolution of Computers
2. Digital Logic
3. Number Representation
4. Instruction Execution Cycle
5. Memory
6. Input & Output
7. Instruction Sets

The order of the topics is roughly the order in which they are taught in the course, with slight modifications
to group related topics together. These notes are best used in conjunction with the course's lecture and tutorial slides
as they provide example questions and exercises. These notes mainly focus on the theoretical and conceptual aspects
of the course, with minimal example questions included.
