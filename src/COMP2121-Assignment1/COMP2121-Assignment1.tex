    \question English Statements and Logic

    \begin{parts}

        \part $(C \land \neg M) \limp \neg S$
        \begin{solution}
            The statement translates to ``If Lady Furina has clues and does not have motive,
            then she does not solve the case.''
        \end{solution}

        \part Rewrite sentence:
        \begin{solution}
            The required logical expression is $(S \land C) \limp T$.
        \end{solution}

        \part Verify if an argument is valid:
        \begin{solution}
            If we rewrite the argument in logical expressions, we have:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item $S \limp C$ \label{q1c:stm1}
                \item $\neg C \limp \neg T$ \label{q1c:stm2}
                \item Therefore, from propositions \ref{q1c:stm1} and \ref{q1c:stm2}, $S \limp T$ \label{q1c:stm3}
            \end{enumerate}
            For the argument to be valid, we require the conclusion (Proposition \ref{q1c:stm3})
            is never false while all the premises (Propositions \ref{q1c:stm1} and \ref{q1c:stm2}) are true.
            It can be verified by trying to find a counterexample, i.e., combinations of $S$, $C$, and $T$
            such that the conclusion is $\lfalse$ while all its premises are $\ltrue$.

            For the conclusion to be $\lfalse$, the only possible case is when $S$ is $\ltrue$ and
            $T$ is $\lfalse$.

            For Proposition \ref{q1c:stm1} to be $\ltrue$ when $S$ is $\ltrue$, $C$ can only be
            $\ltrue$.
            
            When $C$ is $\ltrue$ and $T$ is $\lfalse$, Proposition \ref{q1c:stm2} is $\ltrue$.

            Therefore, when $S$ is $\ltrue$, $C$ is $\ltrue$, and $T$ is $\lfalse$, all premises
            are $\ltrue$ but the conclusion is $\lfalse$, i.e., the argument is \textbf{invalid}.
        \end{solution}

    \question A Logic Puzzle

    \begin{solution}
        First, assume that ``Ja'' means ``Yes'' and ``Da'' means ``No''.

        Assume that A is a knight, then based on his answer, which is the truth, B is
        a spy. Then, C must be the knave since there is exactly one person of one type,
        i.e., the answers from C are lies. For the first question that C was asked,
        he said he would answer ``Ja'', but since he is a knave, that means C would
        actually answer ``Da'' upon being asked. If he answers ``Da (No)'' to the question
        whether A is a knave, he would be lying, and it would mean that A is indeed a
        knave, which is contraditory to our initial assumption. Therefore, this case
        is not true.

        Now, we assume A to be the knave, then when he says he would answer ``Ja'' to
        the question whether B is the spy, he is lying and he would actually answer ``Da''.
        And if so he does, ``B is the spy'' would in fact be the truth, so B is in fact
        the spy. Then C would have to be a knight. Since he always tells the truth, then
        when asked if C were a knave, he would answer ``Ja'', which is the truth. This is
        impossible as C could only be a knight. Therefore, this case is not true.

        Now, we assume A to be the spy, then he can either tells a truth or lie. Assume
        that A answering ``Ja'' to ``If I asked you if B is the spy, would you say Ja?''
        is a truth
    \end{solution}
