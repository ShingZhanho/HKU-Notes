    \question English Statements and Logic

    \begin{parts}

        \part $(C \land \neg M) \limp \neg S$
        \begin{solution}
            The statement translates to ``If Lady Furina has clues and does not have motive,
            then she does not solve the case.''
        \end{solution}

        \part Rewrite sentence:
        \begin{solution}
            The required logical expression is $(S \land C) \limp T$.
        \end{solution}

        \part Verify if an argument is valid:
        \begin{solution}
            If we rewrite the argument in logical expressions, we have:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item $S \limp C$ \label{q1c:stm1}
                \item $\neg C \limp \neg T$ \label{q1c:stm2}
                \item Therefore, from propositions \ref{q1c:stm1} and \ref{q1c:stm2}, $S \limp T$ \label{q1c:stm3}
            \end{enumerate}
            For the argument to be valid, we require the conclusion (Proposition \ref{q1c:stm3})
            is never false while all the premises (Propositions \ref{q1c:stm1} and \ref{q1c:stm2}) are true.
            It can be verified by trying to find a counterexample, i.e., combinations of $S$, $C$, and $T$
            such that the conclusion is $\lfalse$ while all its premises are $\ltrue$.

            For the conclusion to be $\lfalse$, the only possible case is when $S$ is $\ltrue$ and
            $T$ is $\lfalse$.

            For Proposition \ref{q1c:stm1} to be $\ltrue$ when $S$ is $\ltrue$, $C$ can only be
            $\ltrue$.
            
            When $C$ is $\ltrue$ and $T$ is $\lfalse$, Proposition \ref{q1c:stm2} is $\ltrue$.

            Therefore, when $S$ is $\ltrue$, $C$ is $\ltrue$, and $T$ is $\lfalse$, all premises
            are $\ltrue$ but the conclusion is $\lfalse$, i.e., the argument is \textbf{invalid}.
        \end{solution}

    \end{parts}

    \question A Logic Puzzle

    \begin{solution}
        Denote $Q_1:$ ``If I asked you (A) if B is the spy, would you say Ja?'',
        and $Q^A_1$ as the actual question ``Is B the spy?''. Define similarly for
        $Q_2:$ ``If I asked you if you (C) were the knave, would you say Ja?'',
        $Q^A_2:$ ``Are you (C) the knave?'',
        $Q_3:$ ``If I asked you (C) if A is the spy, would you say Ja?'',
        and $Q^A_3:$ ``Is A the spy?''.

        We solve the puzzle by the following tree of assumptions:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Assume ``Ja'' means ``Yes'' and ``Da'' means ``No''.}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Assume A is a knight.}
                
                When we ask $Q_1$ to A, A answers ``Yes''.
                Since A is a knight, he tells the truth, so when we further ask $Q^A_1$ to A,
                A would also answer ``Yes'', which means B is indeed the spy.
                
                Then, C must be the knave.
                
                Since C always lies, when we ask $Q_2$ to C,
                C answers ``Yes'', which is a lie, so when we further ask $Q^A_2$ to C,
                C would actually answer ``No'', which is also a lie, i.e., C is indeed
                the knave.
                
                Now, we ask $Q_3$ to C, and C answers ``No'', which is a lie,
                so when we further ask $Q^A_3$ to C, C would actually answer ``Yes'', which
                is also a lie, i.e., A is not the spy.
                
                \fbox{\textbf{This is a valid solution.}}
                We will further examine other combinations.

                \item \textbf{Assume A is a knave.}
                
                When we ask $Q_1$ to A, A answers ``Yes''. Since A is a knave, he lies,
                so when we further ask $Q^A_1$ to A, A would actually answer ``No'',
                which is also a lie, i.e., B is indeed the spy.
                
                Then, C must be a knight.

                Since C always tells the truth, when we ask $Q_2$ to C, C answers ``Yes'',
                so when we further ask $Q^A_2$ to C, C would also answer ``Yes'', i.e., C
                is the knave. This contradicts our assumption that C is a knight.

                \item \textbf{Assume A is a spy.}
                
                Since A is a spy, when we ask $Q_1$ to A, A can either tell a truth or lie.

                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \textbf{Assume A answering ``Yes'' to $\bm{Q_1}$ is a truth.}
                    
                    When we further ask $Q^A_1$ to A, A indeed answers ``Yes''. Note that
                    this can also have two possibilities: either A answering ``Yes'' to
                    $Q^A_1$ is a truth, or A answering ``Yes'' to $Q^A_1$ is a lie.

                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item \textbf{Assume A answering ``Yes'' to $\bm{Q^A_1}$ is a truth.}
                        
                        Then, B is indeed the spy, which contradicts our assumption that
                        A is the spy.

                        \item \textbf{Assume A answering ``Yes'' to $\bm{Q^A_1}$ is a lie.}
                        
                        Then, B is not the spy.

                        \begin{enumerate}
                            \item \textbf{Assume C is a knight.}
                            
                            Since C always tells the truth, when we ask $Q_2$ to C, C answers
                            ``Yes'', so when we further ask $Q^A_2$ to C, C would also
                            answer ``Yes'', i.e., C is the knave. This contradicts our
                            assumption that C is a knight.

                            \item \textbf{Assume C is a knave.}
                            
                            Since C always lies, when we ask $Q_2$ to C, C answers ``Yes'',
                            which is a lie, so when we further ask $Q^A_2$ to C, C would
                            actually answer ``No'', which is also a lie, i.e., C is indeed
                            the knave.

                            Then, we ask $Q_3$ to C, and C answers ``No'', which is a lie,
                            so when we further ask $Q^A_3$ to C, C would actually answer
                            ``Yes'', which is also a lie, i.e., A is not the spy. This,
                            again, contradicts our assumption that A is the spy.
                        \end{enumerate}
                    \end{itemize}
                    
                    \item \textbf{Assume A answering ``Yes'' to $\bm{Q_1}$ is a lie.}
                    
                    When we further ask $Q^A_1$ to A, A would actually answer ``No''.
                    Again, this can have two possibilities.

                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item \textbf{Assume A answering ``No'' to $\bm{Q^A_1}$ is a truth.}
                        
                        Then, B is not the spy.

                        \begin{enumerate}
                            \item \textbf{Assume C is a knight.}
                            
                            When we ask $Q_2$ to C, C answers ``Yes'', so when we further
                            ask $Q^A_2$ to C, C would indeed answer ``Yes'', i.e., C is the
                            knave. This contradicts our assumption that C is a knight.

                            \item \textbf{Assume C is a knave.}
                            
                            When we ask $Q_2$ to C, C answers ``Yes'', which is a lie,
                            so when we further ask $Q^A_2$ to C, C would actually answer
                            ``No'', which is also a lie, i.e., C is indeed the knave.

                            Then, we ask $Q_3$ to C, and C answers ``No'', which is a lie,
                            so when we further ask $Q^A_3$ to C, C would actually answer
                            ``Yes'', which is also a lie, i.e., A is not the spy. This,
                            again, contradicts our assumption that A is the spy.
                        \end{enumerate}

                        \item \textbf{Assume A answering ``No'' to $\bm{Q^A_1}$ is a lie.}
                        
                        Then, B is indeed the spy. This cannot hold as A is the spy.
                    \end{itemize}
                \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}

            \item \textbf{Assume ``Ja'' means ``No'' and ``Da'' means ``Yes''.}
            
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Assume A is a knight.}
                
                When we ask $Q_1$ to A, A answers ``No'', so when we further ask $Q^A_1$ to
                A, A would say ``Yes'', i.e., B is the spy.
                
                Then, C must be the knave.

                When we ask $Q_2$ to C, C answers ``No'', which is a lie, i.e., C would 
                indeed answer ``Yes'' to $Q^A_2$, which is also a lie, i.e., C is not the
                knave. This contradicts our assumption that C is the knave.

                \item \textbf{Assume A is a knave.}
                
                When we ask $Q_1$ to A, A answers ``No'', which is a lie, so when we further
                ask $Q^A_1$ to A, A would actually answer ``Yes'', which is also a lie, i.e.,
                B is not the spy.

                Then, since B is not the spy, and A is already a knave, B must be the knight,
                and C must be the spy.

                When we ask $Q_2$ to C, C answers ``No'', which can be either a truth or a lie.

                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \textbf{Assume C answering ``No'' to $\bm{Q_2}$ is a truth.}
                    
                    Then, when we ask $Q^A_2$ to C, C would answer ``Yes'', which can also be
                    either a truth or a lie, i.e., C is the knave or C is not the knave.

                    When C answering ``Yes'' to $Q^A_2$ is a lie, then C is not the knave,
                    which checks as we deduced that C is the spy.

                    Next, we ask $Q_3$ to C, and C answers ``Yes'', which can be either a truth
                    or a lie.

                    When C answering ``Yes'' to $Q_3$ is a truth, then when we further ask $Q^A_3$
                    to C, C would answer ``No'', i.e., A can either be the spy (when C is lying)
                    or A is not the spy (when C is telling the truth).

                    When C was indeed telling the truth when answering ``No'' to $Q^A_3$, then A
                    is not the spy, which checks as A is a knave.

                    We have shown that it is possible that when ``Ja'' means ``No'' and ``Da''
                    means ``Yes'', A is a knave, B is a knight, and C is a spy.
                    \fbox{\textbf{This is another valid solution.}}
                \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}

        At this point, we have shown that there are at least two valid solutions:
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tabular}{cc|ccc}
                \textbf{``Ja'' means} & \textbf{``Da'' means} & \textbf{A} & \textbf{B} & \textbf{C} \\
                \hline
                Yes & No & Knight & Spy & Knave \\
                No & Yes & Knave & Knight & Spy
            \end{tabular}
        \end{center}
        It is not useful to continue discussing other cases, as, without extra information,
        it is impossible to determine with certainty the roles of A, B, and C.

        Final answer: \fbox{\textbf{There does not exist a unique solution that can determine the
        roles of A, B, and C with certainty.}}
    \end{solution}

    \question Logical Operators

    \begin{parts}
        
        \part Number of possible 2-to-1 logical operators for inputs $A, B\in\{0,1\}$
        and output $C\in \{0,1\}$.
        \begin{solution}
            Note that for two inputs $A$ and $B$, there are four possible combinations,
            i.e., $(A, B) \in \{(0,0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)\}$. A logical operator
            is a function $f$ that maps the combinations of inputs to an output, i.e.,
            $f: \{0, 1\}^2 \to \{0, 1\}$. Consider the truth table of $f$:
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tabular}{ccc}
                    $\bm{A}$ & $\bm{B}$ & $\bm{C = f(A, B)}$ \\
                    \hline
                    0 & 0 & $f(0, 0)$ \\
                    0 & 1 & $f(0, 1)$ \\
                    1 & 0 & $f(1, 0)$ \\
                    1 & 1 & $f(1, 1)$ 
                \end{tabular}
            \end{center}
            Two logical operators $f$ and $g$ are said to be the same if and only if
            for all combinations of inputs, $f(A, B) = g(A, B)$. Therefore, the problem
            reduces to counting the number of different ways to fill the truth table,
            which is given by $2^4 = 16$.

            Therefore, there are \fbox{\textbf{16}} possible 2-to-1 logical operators.
        \end{solution}

        \part Implement \texttt{NOT}, \texttt{AND}, \texttt{OR}, \texttt{XOR}, and
        \texttt{IMPLIES} using only the logical operator \texttt{NAND}. 
        \begin{solution}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{\texttt{NOT} operator}
                
                Note that $\texttt{NAND}(A, A) \equiv \neg (A \land A) \equiv \neg A \lor \neg A \equiv \neg A$.
                
                Therefore, the \texttt{NOT} operator is implemented as $\boxed{\texttt{NOT}(A) = \texttt{NAND}(A, A)}$.

                \item \textbf{\texttt{OR} operator}
                
                Note that $\neg(\neg A \land \neg B) \equiv A \lor B$,
                which means $\texttt{OR}(A, B)=\texttt{NAND}(\texttt{NOT}(A), \texttt{NOT}(B))$.
                
                Further expand the $\texttt{NOT}$ operators as implemented before, we have:
                $\boxed{\texttt{OR}(A, B)=\texttt{NAND}\left[\texttt{NAND}(A, A), \texttt{NAND}(B,B)\right]}$.

                \item \textbf{\texttt{AND} operator}
                
                Note that if we apply \texttt{NAND} on the result of $\texttt{NAND}(A, B)$, we have:
                $$\neg\left[\neg\left(A\land B\right)\land\neg\left(A\land B\right)\right]
                \equiv \left(A\land B\right)\lor\left(A \land B\right)
                \equiv A \land \left(B \lor B\right)
                \equiv A \land B$$

                Therefore, the \texttt{AND} operator is implemented as
                \fbox{$\topr{AND}{A}{B}=\topr{NAND}{\topr{NAND}{A}{B}}{\topr{NAND}{A}{B}}$}.

                \item \textbf{\texttt{XOR} operator}
                
                Recall that $A\lxor B
                \equiv (A\lor B)\land\neg(A\land B)$. From this expression, we continue to derive:
                \begin{align*}
                    (A\lor B)\land\neg(A\land B)

                    &\equiv \neg[\neg(A\land\neg(A\land B))\land\neg(B\land\neg(A\land B))] \qquad\text{(De Morgan's Law)}\\

                Expand the expression, we have:
                \begin{align*}

        \part Prove that $\forall xP(x)\land\exists xQ(x) \equiv \forall x \exists y (P(x)\land Q(y))$.
        \begin{psol}
            Rename the variable on the left-hand side, we have:
            $$\forall xP(x)\land\exists yQ(y) \equiv \forall x\exists y(P(x)\land Q(y))$$
            To prove equivalence, we prove both the sufficiency and necessity.
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item \textbf{Sufficiency:} $\forall xP(x)\land\exists yQ(y) \Rightarrow \forall x\exists y(P(x)\land Q(y))$
                
                Assume that the L.H.S. is true, then for all $x$, $P(x)$ must hold.
                Also, there must exist at least one $y$, say $y_0$, such that $Q(y_0)$ holds.
                Therefore, for all $x$, we can always find a $y$, which is $y_0$, such that
                $P(x)\land Q(y)$ holds. We have displayed that the R.H.S. must be true if
                the L.H.S. is true.

                \item \textbf{Necessity:} $\forall xP(x)\land\exists yQ(y) \Leftarrow \forall x\exists y(P(x)\land Q(y))$
                
                Assume that the R.H.S. (i.e., $\forall x\exists y(P(x)\land Q(y))$) is true,
                then for all $x$, we can always find a $y$, say $y_0$, such that $P(x)\land Q(y_0)$
                holds. Therefore, for all $x$, $P(x)$ must hold, and there must exist at least one $y$,
                which is $y_0$, such that $Q(y_0)$ holds. We have displayed that the L.H.S. must be true if
                the R.H.S. is true.
            \end{enumerate}
            Since both the sufficiency and necessity have been proved, we conclude that
            $\forall xP(x)\land\exists xQ(x) \liff \forall x \exists y (P(x)\land Q(y))$
            is a tautology, i.e., the two statements are logically equivalent.
        \end{psol}

        \part Justify whether $\exists x \forall y P(x, y) \limp \forall y \exists x P(x, y)$
        is always a tautology for any predicate $P(x, y)$.
        \begin{solution}
            We propose that the given proposition is not always a tautology, and we attempt
            to find an example, such that the proposition is a contradiction.

            $\exists x \forall y P(x,y) \limp \forall y \exists x P(x,y)$ is a contradiction
            iff $\exists x \forall y P(x,y)$ is $\ltrue$ and $\forall y \exists x P(x,y)$ is
            $\lfalse$.

            If the antecedent is true, then, for at least one $x$, say $x_0$, $P(x_0, y)$
            holds for all $y$.

            If the consequent is false, then, for at least one $y$, say $y_0$, there does not
            exist any $x$ such that $P(x, y_0)$ holds.

            However, if $P(x_0, y)$ holds for all $y$, then $P(x_0, y_0)$ must also hold.
            Therefore, such $y_0$ does not exist, and the consequent can never be false if
            the antecedent is true.

            Therefore, we cannot find a counterexample such that the antecedent is true
            while the consequent is false. Hence, the given proposition is always a tautology.

    \question Proofs

    \begin{parts}
        
        \part Determine the validity of a proof.
        \begin{solution}
            Step 1: Valid. This is implication law ($P \limp Q \equiv \neg P \lor Q$).

            Step 2: Valid. Renaming the variable $x$ to $y$ does not change the meaning of
            the statement. This is also the distribution law of $\forall$ over $\land$ --
            $\forall x P(x) \land \forall y Q(y) \equiv \forall x (P(x) \land Q(x))$.

            Step 3: Valid. This step combines application of several laws:
            \begin{align*}
                &\equiv \forall x[(P(x)\land\neg Q(x)) \lor (Q(x)\land\neg Q(x))] \qquad\text{(Distribution law)}\\
                &\equiv \forall x[(P(x)\land\neg Q(x)) \lor \lfalse] \qquad\text{(Contradiction law)}\\
                &\equiv \forall x[P(x)\land\neg Q(x)] \qquad\text{(Identity law)}
            \end{align*}

            Step 4: Valid. This is the simplification (i.e., $P\land Q \limp P$).

            Step 5: Valid. First, since $\forall x P(x)$ is true, then $P(c)$ must be true
            for any $c$ in the universe of dicourse. Then, since there exists at least one
            $x$, $c$ in this case, such that $P(x)$ is true, then $\exists x P(x)$ is true.
        \end{solution}

        \part Proof by Induction.
        \begin{psol}
            Denote $P(n) : \ds{\sum_{k=1}^n \cos(kx) = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\sin\left[\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right)x\right]}{\sin\left(\frac{1}{2}x\right)}-1\right)}$.

            \textbf{Base Case:} $n=1$.
            \begin{equation*}
                \text{L.H.S.} = \sum_{k=1}^1 \cos(kx) = \cos(x)
            \end{equation*}
            \begin{align*}
                \text{R.H.S.} &= \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\sin\frac{3}{2}x}{\sin\frac{1}{2}x}-1\right)\\
                &= \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\sin\frac{3}{2}x-\sin\frac{1}{2}x}{\sin\frac{1}{2}x}\right)\\
                &= \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{2\cos x\sin\frac{1}{2}x}{\sin\frac{1}{2}x}\right)\\
                &= \cos x \\
                &= \text{L.H.S.}
            \end{align*}
            Therefore, $P(1)$ holds.

            \textbf{Inductive Step:} Assume that $P(n)$ holds for $n\geq 1$. We show that $P(n+1)$ also holds.
            \begin{align*}
                \text{L.H.S.} &= \sum_{k=1}^{n+1} \cos(kx) \\
                &= \sum_{k=1}^n \cos(kx) + \cos\left((n+1)x\right) \\
                &= P(n) + \cos\left((n+1)x\right) \\
                &= \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\sin\left[\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right)x\right]}{\sin\frac{1}{2}x}-1\right) + \cos\left((n+1)x\right) \\
                &= \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\sin\left[\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right)x\right]-\sin\frac{1}{2}x}{\sin\frac{1}{2}x}\right) + \cos\left((n+1)x\right) \\
                &= \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{2\cos\left[\frac{n+1}{2}x\right]\sin\left[\frac{n}{2}x\right]}{\sin\frac{1}{2}x}\right) + \cos\left((n+1)x\right) \\
                &= \frac{\cos\left[\frac{n+1}{2}x\right]\sin\left[\frac{n}{2}x\right] + \cos\left((n+1)x\right)\sin\frac{1}{2}x}{\sin\frac{1}{2}x} \\
                &= \frac{\sin\left[\frac{2n+1}{2}x\right]-\sin\frac{1}{2}x+\sin\left[\frac{2n+3}{2}x\right]-\sin\left[\frac{2n+1}{2}x\right]}{2\sin\frac{1}{2}x} \\
                &= \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\sin\left[\frac{2n+3}{2}x\right]}{\sin\frac{1}{2}x}-1\right) \\
                &= \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\sin\left[\left(\left(n+1\right)+\frac{1}{2}\right)x\right]}{\sin\frac{1}{2}x}-1\right) \\
                &= \text{R.H.S.}
            \end{align*}
            Therefore, $P(n) \Rightarrow P(n+1)$.

            By the principle of mathematical induction, $P(n)$ holds for all $n\geq 1$.
