\begin{questions}

    \question Consider a hypothetical machine with 1K words of cache memory. They are in a two-way set
    associative organisation, with a cache block size of 128 words, using LRU replacement algorithm.
    Suppose the cache hit time is 10 ns, the time to transfer the first word from main memory to cache
    is 60 ns, while subsequent words require 12 ns/word.
    \label{question-2way-set-cache}

    Consider the following read pattern (in blocks of 128 words, and block ID starts from 0),
    and assume each block has 48 references:

    \begin{verbatim}
        1 2 3 5 6 2 3 4 9 10 11 6 3 6 1 7 8 4 5 9 11 1 2 4 5 12 13 14 15 13 14
    \end{verbatim}

    \begin{parts}

        \part What is the cache miss penalty (i.e., time to transfer one block of data from
        main memory to cache memory)?

        \part Write down the content of the cache memory (for all the blocks) at the end of
        the memory references, assuming that the cache is empty at the beginning.

        \part Write down the number of cache misses (the first reading of a block is also
        considered a miss), and the cache hit rate.

        \part Calculate the average memory access time.

    \end{parts}

    \question Repeat Question \ref{question-2way-set-cache} for a direct-mapped cache organisation
    with the cache hit time being 9 ns. All other parameters remain the same.

    \question Consider a Hard Disk with an average seek time of 12 ms and rotation speed of
    7200 rpm, and an average number of 500 sectors per track. Assume negligible
    transfer time.

    \begin{parts}

        \part What is the average rotation latency?

        \part What is the average time to rotate for 1 sector?

        \part Consider the access of 5 sectors. Caculate the time required (ignoring tranfer
        time, but including rotation time for reading a sector) if

        \begin{subparts}

            \subpart The sectors are consecutive in the same track.

            \subpart The sectors are scattered in various places in the HDD.

        \end{subparts}

    \end{parts}
