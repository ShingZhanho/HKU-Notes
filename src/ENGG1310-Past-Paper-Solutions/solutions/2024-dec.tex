\begin{questions}

\titledquestion{2024 Dec Q1}
\begin{solution}
    \mcqAns{A}

    Holes are defined as the absence of electrons in the valence band, they cannot ``move'' to the conduction band.
    Therefore, D and E are incorrect.
    Electrons cannot exist in the band gap, so C is incorrect.
    Electrons have more energy in the conduction band than in the valence band, so A is correct.
\end{solution}

\titledquestion{2024 Dec Q2}
\begin{solution}
    \mcqAns{C}

    In a p-type (``p'' stands for ``positive'') semiconductor, the majority carriers are holes.
    Therefore, A and B are incorrect.
    Since holes are the majority carriers, there are more holes than electrons, so C is correct and D is incorrect.
\end{solution}

\titledquestion{2024 Dec Q3}
\begin{solution}
    \mcqAns{C}

    In a reverse-biased diode, no current flows through, so A and B are incorrect.
    To put the diode in reverse bias, a higher potential must be applied to the n-type side, i.e., cathode, so C is correct and D is incorrect.
\end{solution}

\titledquestion{2024 Dec Q4}
\begin{solution}
    \mcqAns{E}

    In a forward-biased diode, the mathematical relationship between input voltage and output current is exponential, so only E is correct.
    (Side note: in a reverse-biased diode, the relationship remains rather constant.)
\end{solution}

\titledquestion{2024 Dec Q5}
\begin{solution}
    \mcqAns{B}

    \texttt{NAND} gates (or any gates involving \texttt{NOT}) need to be constructed using active components, i.e., transistors, so only B is correct.
    The other options are all passive components.
\end{solution}

\titledquestion{2024 Dec Q6}
\begin{solution}
    \mcqAns{C}
    
    Transconductance $g_m$ measures how well the input voltage is converted to output current, so C is correct.
\end{solution}
