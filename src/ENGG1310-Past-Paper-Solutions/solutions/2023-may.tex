\begin{solution}
    \mcqAns{C}

    \begin{enumualpha}
        \item Bandgap energy in semiconductors are non-zero in order to control the flow of current, so A is incorrect.
        \item Apart from group IV elements, semiconductors are usually made by doping group IV elements with group III or group V elements, so B is incorrect.
        \item Doping will increase the number of charge carriers, therefore altering the conductivity of the material, so C is correct.
        \item Electrical conductivity depends on temperature, so D is incorrect.
    \end{enumualpha}
