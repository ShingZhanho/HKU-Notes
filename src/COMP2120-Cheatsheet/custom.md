## Instructions for Printing

The PDF provided takes up the whole A4 page. Therefore, if you print the PDF at 100% scale, some of the contents
at the edges will be cut off. Please use the option "Fit to Page" in your system's print dialog to ensure that
the whole cheatsheet is printed correctly.

## Adding Figures to Your Printed Cheatsheet

The examination may contain questions that are easier to solve if you have access to certain figures (including but
not limited to the figures in the [COMP2120-Notes](./COMP2120-Notes.md) and those included in the course materials). However, the figures
are too large to be automatically typeset by LaTeX. Therefore, you may consider drawing them on the printed cheatsheet.

Suggested figures to include:

1. Floating-point number arithmetic operations flowcharts.
2. The flowchart of paging operations (of virtual memory).
3. Diagrams about Direct Memory Access (DMA) (please refer to the course slides) **(This was tested in the 2025 May examination.)**.
