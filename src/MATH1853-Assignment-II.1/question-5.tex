Find all solutions to \( z^3 = (2 + 2i)^6 \). Write your answer in set notation.

\begin{solution}
    For $w=2+2i$, $|w| = \sqrt{2^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2}$ and $\arg(w) = \tan^{-1}(1) = \frac{\pi}{4}$.
    Thus, $w=2\sqrt{2} e^{i\pi/4}$, and $w^6 = (2\sqrt{2})^6 e^{i6\pi/4} = 512 e^{i3\pi/2}$.

    For $z^3=re^{i\theta}$, we have
    \[
        z_k = r^{1/3} e^{i(\theta + 2k\pi)/3} \quad \text{for } k=0,1,2.
    \]

    Therefore, the solution set is given by
    \[
        \boxed{\left\{8e^{i\pi/2}, 8e^{i7\pi/6}, 8e^{i11\pi/6}\right\}}
    \]
\end{solution}
