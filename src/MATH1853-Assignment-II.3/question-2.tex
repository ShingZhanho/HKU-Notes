\question
In Major League Baseball, the World Series determines the champion team.
The team that wins four games in a series of up to seven games wins the World Series.
This year, the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers faced the Toronto Blue Jays.
What was the probability that Shohei Otani leads the Dodgers to back-to-back championships?
Assume thae probability that the Dodgers win a game against the Blue Jays is 0.55.

\begin{solution}
    Let $X$ count the number of gams until 4 wins by Dodgers.
    Then $X\sim\text{NegativeBinomial}(n=4,p=0.55)$.
    The PMF is given by
    \[
        p(x)=\binom{x-1}{3}(0.55)^4(0.45)^{x-4},\quad x=4,5,6,7.
    \]
    Then, \begin{align*}
        P(\text{champion}) &= \sum_{i=4}^{7} p(i)
        = p(4) + p(5) + p(6) + p(7) \\
        &= \binom{3}{3}(0.55)^4(0.45)^0 + \binom{4}{3}(0.55)^4(0.45)^1 + \binom{5}{3}(0.55)^4(0.45)^2 + \binom{6}{3}(0.55)^4(0.45)^3 \\
        &\approx 0.09151 + 0.1647 + 0.1853 + 0.1668
        = \boxed{0.60831}.
    \end{align*}
