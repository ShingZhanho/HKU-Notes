\question
You are planning a photo session with your 7 best friends.
In how many ways can your 7 friends stand in a line for the photo if you must be standing in between your two childhood friends immediately on your left and right?

\begin{solution}
    There are 2 ways to arrange your two childhood friends on your left and right.
    Then, treating you and your two childhood friends as an entity, there are 6 entities to arrange.
    Thus, there are $6!$ ways to arrange these 6 entities.
    Therefore, the total number of ways is $2 \times 6! = \boxed{1440}$.
\end{solution}
