\question
In a survey of student skills in a coding bootcamp, it was found that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 65\% of students are proficient in Python
    \item 60\% of students are proficient in SQL
    \item 35\% of students are proficient in JavaScript
    \item 10\% of students are proficient in all three languages
    \item 30\% of students are proficient in both Python and SQL
    \item 25\% of students are proficient in both SQL and JavaScript
    \item 20\% of students are proficient in both Python and JavaScript
\end{itemize}
A student is selected at random. What is the probability they are proficient in exactly one of these three languages?

\begin{solution}
    Let $Y$, $S$, and $J$ denote the events that a student is proficient in Python, SQL, and JavaScript respectively.
    We can draw the Venn diagram:
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \begin{venndiagram3sets}[
            labelA=$Y$,
            labelB=$S$,
            labelC=$J$,
            labelOnlyA=$25\%$,
            labelOnlyB=$15\%$,
            labelOnlyC=$0\%$,
            labelOnlyAB=$20\%$,
            labelOnlyBC=$15\%$,
            labelOnlyAC=$10\%$,
            labelABC=$10\%$,
            labelNotABC=$5\%$,
            radius=1.5cm,
            overlap=1.3cm
        ]
        \end{venndiagram3sets}
    \end{figure}
    By the diagram, the required probability is
    \[
        P(Y\text{ only}) + P(S\text{ only}) + P(J\text{ only}) = 25\% + 15\% + 0\% = \boxed{40\%}.
    \]
\end{solution}
