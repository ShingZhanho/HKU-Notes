\question
A fair six-sided die is rolled 5 times, and the number faced up is recorded for each roll.
What is the probability that the first and last rolls are even numbers, given that exactly three even numbers were rolled in total?

\begin{solution}
    Denote the events: $F:$ ``first roll is even'', $L:$ ``last roll is even'', and $T:$ ``exactly three rolls are even''.
    \[
        P(T)=\binom{5}{3}\cdot\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^5=\frac{5}{16},
    \]
    \[
        P(F)=P(L)=\frac{1}{2}.
    \]
    By independence, $\displaystyle P(F\cap L)=P(F)P(L)=\frac{1}{4}$.

    Then, $\displaystyle P(F\cap L \mid T)=\frac{P(F\cap L\cap T)}{P(T)}=\frac{16}{5}P(F\cap L\cap T)$.

    Note that $\displaystyle P(F\cap L\cap T)=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\cdot\binom{3}{1}\cdot\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3\cdot\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{3}{32}$.

    Therefore, $\displaystyle P(F\cap L \mid T)=\frac{16}{5}\cdot\frac{3}{32}=\boxed{\frac{3}{10}}$.
