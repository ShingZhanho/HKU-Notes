This is a set of questions compiled from the past 4 years of in-class quizzes
of the course CCGL9042 The Evolution of Civilisation. 

!!! note "Potential issues with Quiz 10 and 11"
    In the past, the quizzes 10 and 11 were held as one single quiz. Therefore, in the
    past question bank, those questions were not separated. In recent years, the quizzes
    have been separated, and the author has tried his best to separate the questions
    into two quizzes. However, there is still chance that some questions in Quiz 10
    will appear in Quiz 11, and vice versa. You are advised to revise both sections
    when preparing for quiz 10 and quiz 11.
