Welcome to the repository! This is a collection of notes, examination cheatsheets, and other resources
for courses provided by the University of Hong Kong (mainly for the Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science "_BEng(CompSc)_" programme).

!!! example "Website New Look"

    We are introducing a brand new look for the website by switching from [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to the new generation engine [Zensical](https://zensical.org/docs/).
    We are still testing out the new engine, you can switch between the two versions below:

    [Legacy Version](https://hku.jacobshing.com/) { .md-button .md-button--primary } | [New Version](https://hku.jacobshing.com/beta/) { .md-button .md-button--primary }

    The two versions are identical in terms of content, but the new version has the comment system disabled for now.
