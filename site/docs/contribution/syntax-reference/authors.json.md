# Syntax Reference for `authors.json`

The `authors.json` file is found under the `/site/docs/statics/authors/` directory.
It contains information about the authors of the documents in the HKU Notes project.

Each author is represented as a JSON object, with its unique identifier as the key.

!!! warning "Naming Convention for Author Identifiers"

    Identifiers with a leading at sign (`@`) are reserved called pseudo-authors.
    They are used for controlling how authors are displayed. Defining an identifier
    with a leading at sign (`@`) in this file will result in an error.

Each author object must define all of the following fields:

## `display_name`

- **Description**: The name of the author as it should be displayed.
- **Type**: `string`
- **Example**: `"John Appleseed"`

## `avatar`

- **Description**: The URL of the author's avatar image.
- **Type**: `string` or `null`
- **Example**: `"https://example.com/avatar.jpg"`

Authors without a hosted avatar can place their avatar image in the `/site/docs/statics/authors/` directory,
and reference it using `https://hku.jacobshing.com/statics/authors/[avatar_filename]`. Or,
if they wish, leave this field as `null` to use the default avatar.

## `href`

- **Description**: A URL to the author's profile or homepage. Leave this field as `null` if the author does not wish to provide a link.
- **Type**: `string` or `null`
- **Example**: `"https://example.com/profile"`

# Example

```json
{
    "john_appleseed": {
        "display_name": "John Appleseed",
        "avatar": "https://example.com/avatar.jpg",
        "href": "https://example.com/profile"
    }
}
```
