# HKU Notes

HKU Notes is my personal revision resources management project for the courses I took
at The University of Hong Kong in pursuit of my Bachelor of Engineering (Computer Science)
degree.

All resources are written in LaTeX. The purpose of this repository is to store the notes
remotely and use GitHub Actions to automatically compile and distribute the notes online.

## Guidelines on Working with the Compilation System

In case I myself forget how to use the compilation system I designed, or in case that
you are interested in adding your own notes to this repository, checkout the Wiki page
for how the automation works.

## History of the Project

Originally, this project started at [notes for COMP2120](https://github.com/ShingZhanho/COMP2120-Notes)
and as I planned to add more notes for other courses, I decided to create a new repository
to manage them at one place. The original notes are also ported to this repository.

I took some time to redesign the automation process to make it more efficient and provide
more features for myself, such as pre-/post-compile scripts, and a better designed
static website for downloading the notes.

The original COMP2120 notes repository is now archived and will not be updated.
